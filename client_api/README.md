# Client

This will contain an API with the main functionalities accesible by a client:

- Log in
- Log out
- Upload file
- Download file
- View uploaded files
- Remove uploaded file

These functions will handle all the client-server comunication. This layer of
absrtaction allows the implementation of CLI or GUI applications in an easy and
clean way.
